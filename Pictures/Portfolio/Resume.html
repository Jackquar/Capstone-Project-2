  <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I'm a Full Stack Developer and Designer. I'm fluent in Photoshop, Illustrator, and even Figma!
        I'm learning front end at the moment and will be soon learning backend. I thought to branch out into computer programming.
        It feels like computer programing is the future.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I graduated from Charles W. Flanagan High School. Went into trying out Graphic Design in Broward College. I tried out the Art Insitute via video games. Even try to continue it by Dade College. 
        All those extra classes really had me lose sight of why I entered those programs. Feeling like I was wasting time in those programs and felt like maybe I wasn't good enough. 
        All due to dropping out of those programs. Knowing what I know now, I should have made a path that works better for me personally instead of thinking College was the only way and blaming myself into sabotaging myself.
        Now, I'm diving into Full-Stack Developer.</p>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>My first job was Rotating Sales and Support at the Sawgrass Mills at the Nordstrom Rack for a year.
        I tried Walmart (3-4months), Kmart (1 month), and even Macys (4 Months). I did Taco Bell for 2 weeks.
        I did 1 full year at the Cheesecake Factory, 4 months with Oreily's. I did 4 months in BDC at Subaru of Pembroke Pines. 
        It shows I explored and I remember each of these jobs. I tried my best to what I could at that time.
        Now I am working as a freelancer as a Designer at the Flyland Company. 
        I'm looking to expand into computer programing. </p>
